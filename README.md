# Task Management API
[PortuguÃªs (BR)](./README.pt-br.md)


A REST API for managing tasks (Create, Read, Update, Delete), built with Java and the Spring Boot framework. This project is a demonstration of modern backend development practices, including a layered architecture, RESTful principles, and database integration.

## Technologies Used

* **Java 24:** The core programming language.
* **Spring Boot 3:** The main application framework for building the web server and managing components.
* **Spring Data JPA:** For database interaction and object-relational mapping (ORM).
* **H2 Database:** An in-memory database for development and testing.
* **Gradle:** The project build and dependency management tool.
* **Docker:** For containerizing the application for easy deployment.

| `GET`    | `/{id}`              | Retrieves a single task by its ID.            |
| `POST`   | `/`                  | Creates a new task.                           |
